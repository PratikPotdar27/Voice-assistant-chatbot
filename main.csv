This is my first ac I have ever bought and I am pretty happy with my purchase. The ac is good and working fine till now. I bought this AC for Rs. 28,490/- on 20th April, got it delivered on 26th April and Installation was done on 27th April. I paid Rs. 600/- (499+18% GST) for Installation and the installation was done in a good manner.
The Technician asked me about the Stand for Outdoor Unit but I told him to install it on the MS Grill (see the image) this way I saved Rs. 800/- Yay!!! I bought this AC for my Bedroom of 10x12 ft. The Indoor Unit makes a little noise in the beginning but slowly settles and the Outdoor Unit makes a quite huge sound (May be it's a product behaviour) But luckily there's the kitchen of my neighbour next to where I placed the OU, so they didn't complain me about the OU, otherwise something would have happened. Also, the remote is not working properly , looks like there's some loose connection in the battery area.
Coming to Cooling, it takes around 7-8 minutes to get the temperature down when you turn on the Turbo Mode. It consumes around 6-8 units of electricity for 10-12 hours of usage. Overall, a great and a satisfactory experience.",1,amazon,1_Ton_3_Star,PeeZee,5.0,,

I purchased this AC before the lockdown in March
and I have been using this AC since then. This is a value for money AC in my opinion provided you manage to get cheap installation. The installation costs for me was 1300 Rs/- as had purchased the stand for Outdoor Unit from Whirlpool Service personnel. The AC itself has been very good for our room which is small at 90 Square fit. The cooling is sufficient even at 25Â°C considering the humidity outside and the noise level is low(provided your AC is well maintained at home, more on this later). One very crucial point about ACs which I learned was that it is very important to service ACs at home. And by service I mean clean the air filters in the AC which was very easy to do. I had not cleaned the air filters for 2 months and the cooling suddenly deteriorated, the fan speed became much lower and my electricity bill came at about 6500 Rs/- as I had to use my AC longer and at 20Â°C to get the same amount of cooling as I would normally get at 25Â°C. I was initially shocked and started to regret my purchase. The AC started making wierd noises as if a piece of cloth got stuck in a ceiling fan. It got quite annoying as even lowering the fan speed did not help. However after carefully reading the manual I got to know that we need to clear the air filters in the AC every month for effective cooling and to reduce power bills. After I cleaned the air filters, the cooling improved drastically and now I get even better cooling than I did back in March. The noise is completely gone and the AC is absolutely silent now.
*FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH AN AC? PROBABLY WANNA LOOK ELSEWHERE*
The service engineers did not communicate this effective peice of information to me, and I was unaware about this part as this was the first AC I had purchased. That is the only reason I have deducted a star from the rating as the installation and demo could have been much better. The product though is great. Whirlpool is a reliable brand and I also received a call from Whirlpool even during lockdown to ensure that my installation was done properly. I suppose one more con could be that they only offer one free servicing. This does not seem to affect me personally as I am henceforth going to service the AC myself at home and it does yield much better results as per my online research.
If you have made it through till here, then you probably want to buy this product, so all I will say is this: watch videos on AC Servicing on YouTube and try to gauge if you can do it yourself. If you cannot then you may want to go with a Voltas or Daikin or Carrier as they offer better service in my opinion. However if you do choose to buy this product and you know how to use it, you will not regret it as the cooling at its peak is just superb. I hope I was able to give an honest feedback from a first time AC buyer's perspective.",0,amazon,1_Ton_3_Star,anish,4.0,,

The installation service request was raised automatically upon delivery of the product. Still we called whirlpool customer care to ensure installation is done as quickly as possible on 7th March. The installation person arrived on 9th March after ensuring availability of both sides.
We knew the issues raised while going through the reviews before purchase, therefore we bought the outdoor stand separately at a lower cost (INR 490) from Amazon itself. The installation person arrived with there own stand and tried to fool us by saying that the one purchased by us is of poor quality and will not hold the ac. We were aware of there smart intention, so we declined on his face. He was selling the outdoor stand at INR 900 (whirlpool sales this item at 800), he tried to gain here as well.
Then, he asked us to pay additional INR 250 to install the outdoor stand separately with the overall installation cost of INR 499 + 18% GST. This way they try to fool the clients. We had long argument and declined whatever he asked us to do. So, in this way we saved unnecessary cost which installation person tried to put on us.

I see many negative comments as installation issues. My installation guy was superb. Fitted it and even placed the ac on the top of the hole on wall, so that no one see it.
The installation cost was 499+ tax, extra 600+ tax if you need outdoor brackets.
About the ac it's good, really silent, my child even loved it, also we can dim the ac indication light.
Nice cooling, effective
Anyway my first ac and good experience.",0,amazon,1_Ton_3_Star,Paulbin Jacob,4.0,,

Pros:
1) idu small size, thats because of 1 ton.
2) neat and clean design with a beautiful greyish borderline on the front face.
3) very energy efficient. At temp 24 and above it consumes very low power.
4) remote features are nice and user friendly. Lots of advanced features to control, like around u,eco,6th sense,silent,turbo,sleep. The power button on remote probably has radium, it glows at night.
5) the silent mode is amazing. The machine operates almost silently in true sense.
6) full copper wire and nicely wrapped by a soft material tape by the technician.
7) has 4 levels of vertical swing which are stagnant and also an automatic one which keeps on moving
8) the dim feature is very handy, the display light turns off. But i keep it on as it almost works like a night bulb at night.
9) i live in top floor and the machine cools down the room within 10 mins if kept at 20-22degree. My room size 110 sq.ft.
10) the build quality is definitely good if not superior.
11) inbuilt stabilizer works efficiently. The voltage of my house keeps fluctuating. Still i showed the courage of not using stabilizer, and it has lived up to my expectations till now.
12) most important, the price range. I got it for 25k and this was the lowest i could get of a branded company and that too with all such loaded and advanced features.
Cons:
1) no horizontal swing
2) no bacteria or germ filter or air purifier
3) bit noisy in normal mode
4) technicians were by no means of the standard of whirlpool.
i)They kept on repeatedly insisting me to install stabilizer which they had brought with them. They said that it would cost 4500 whereas i showed them stabilizers were available at much lower price
in amazon itself, to which they did not have answer. At last i did not agree to buy it.
ii) My window shelves are quite wide and the odu could be easily installed in my window. But they kept insisting me to install the odu outdoor(so that i have to buy the brackets). I finally gave in to this.
iii) they were poorly handling the machine and once they almost let it fall had i not been nearby to support it
iv) they could not explain me the remote features properly. More surprisingly they said the eco and 6th sense button should not be used as they are only for repair personnel!
v) they billed me 2200 out of which 1100 for the bracket and 600 for installation. Rest i did not understand what they billed for. They did not even give me a seperate bill for the bracket so i dont know whether it actually cost 1100 or not. also they did not mention how much gst rate was included in the bill.
Overall an amazing product from whirlpool and a very suitable price range for the indian market. Delivery from amazon was also fast and good. Though very disappointed by the installing technicians. I urge Whirlpool to look into it.",1,amazon,1_Ton_3_Star,Saurav,5.0,,
